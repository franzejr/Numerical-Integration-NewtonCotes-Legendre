#Gauss Legendre and Newton-Cotes rules

Newton-Cotes rules are a group of formulae for numerical integration (also called quadrature) 
based on evaluating the integrand at equally-spaced points.

Gauss Legendre the associated polynomials are Legendre polynomials, Pn(x), and the method is usually known as Gaussâ€“Legendre quadrature. With the nth polynomial normalized to give Pn(1) = 1, the ith Gauss node, xi, is the ith root of Pn.
